              <br />The core principle of the system is that it can
              intelligently buy cryptocurrencies at low prices from various
              exchanges, and then sell cryptocurrencies at high prices, and
              generate profits from high-frequency transactions (buying and
              selling)
            </p>
            <p class="fs-14">
              <br />For example: the system purchased USDT worth 10,000 USD from
              Coinbase, and then sold it at Binance at a price of 10,100 USDT.
              The exchange rate difference of 100 USDT generated in this
              transfer transaction is the transaction profit
